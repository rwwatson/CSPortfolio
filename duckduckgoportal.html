        Regrade Policy: <br> 
        It must be objectively clear that an error was made during grading. <br>
        Examples of such errors include a grader incorrectly summing points or incorrectly marking something not completed. <br>
        In particular, grades for categories like "Site is Visually Appealing" will not be regraded. <br> 
        All regrade requests must be submitted by email to cse330ta@gmail.com within one week of grading. <br>
        Requests submitted after this deadline will not be considered. <br>
        Requests must contain a specific explanation of the error, including filenames and line numbers of code, if appropriate. <br>
